# Web Apps Starter

<!-- > 2020-03-19T14:45:40+0800 -->

A framework with webpack integrated,
empowering you to start quantities of applications at ease.


## 0. Introduction

It was like always,
you are building multiple modern HTML pages or even multiple single-page apps,
with scripted bundled by webpack.

You are going to develop with one or more targeted pages or apps
--- your mind shifts around as the project moves on,
and finally build and deploy them all at once or in reasonably-several batches.

If coincidentally you have a similar workflow to build multiple standalone apps,
this repo may help you walk out.


## I. Usage

Add as a git remote repo, then fetch and merge.

```bash
git remote add tmplt https://github.com/zhanbei/Web-Apps-Starter.git

git fetch tmplt master

# Prepare(Clean) your workspace for the files to be merged.
git merge tmplt/master

# Fix potential conflicts and commit.
git commit -m '[*] Merged remote tmplt repo from github@zhanbei#Web-Apps-Starter.'
```
